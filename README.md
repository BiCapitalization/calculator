# calculator

This is a simple calculator written in Haskell, mainly for my own learning
purposes. Currently, the only way the calculator can be invoked is by passing an
expression as the first argument on the command line.

## Features

Following functionality is currently supported:
 - The four basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
 - Unary `+` and `-`
 - Parenthesized expressions
 - Basic operator precedence rules
